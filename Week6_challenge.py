## Lesson 3 - Challenge
- Consider `Faces/usrc_all.png` and `Faces/usrc_cropped.png`. 
Using the face detection in part 1, tune the face detection so that all the faces 
in the cropped version are accounted for and there are no extra faces in the uncropped 
version. (Except for the clock. Apparently the clock looks like a face.)

- For each detected face (including the clock, I guess) use the imageFrame in 
`Faces/imageframe.png` to enframe the face, putting the resultant images into 
an output folder.
